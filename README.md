# Improving Procedural Game Level Generation with Generative Adverserial Networks

Current work done: baseline model that gives _some_ kind of output. Its pretty bad to be completely honest, but it works.

The plan: To make multiple versions of the same GAN model.
1 - Baseline model with current parameters
2 - Improved model with current parameters
3 - Improved model with optimized parameters
4 - Baseline model with optimized parameters

Possible additions: using LSE and CMA.
